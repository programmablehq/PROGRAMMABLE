# API reference

## Module Mode

For Foundation launch indexing, start with [Foundation discovery](https://programmable.market/api/module-foundation) and the [Foundation integration guide](foundation-indexing.md). It links the factory, token, hook and module ABIs used by the verifier. Resolve an existing coin's release with `GET /api/module-foundation?token={checksummedTokenAddress}`. The Native V1 indexer contract below belongs to the earlier Native source and must not be used to decode Foundation events.

Read [agent discovery](https://programmable.market/api/agent) for the current contribution workflow and CLI manifest. Before building, use the authenticated `GET /v1/modules/context` at `https://api.programmable.market`, or the current CLI's `module-context` command. It provides the key-bound author, default reward wallet, prerequisites, open source-intake contract and separate review coverage. The [module API guide](https://programmable.market/developers/module-mode-api-v1.md) defines the complete preparation, submission and review flow. The [indexer JSON contract](https://programmable.market/api/module-mode/indexer/v1) publishes the native source ABI and identity rules; the [indexing guide](module-mode-indexing.md) explains the verification procedure. Read the current release from [Module Mode availability](https://programmable.market/api/module-mode).

## Custom Launch APIs

Start with the [API quickstart](custom-launch-quickstart.md). Use [live discovery](https://programmable.market/.well-known/programmable.json) to select a chain, profile and client release.

| Integration | Contract |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Robinhood, separate token and hook | V4 OpenAPI and pack configuration selected by discovery |
| Robinhood, shared token and hook | [MultiRole V2 capabilities](https://api.programmable.market/v4/chains/4663/multi-role-custom-launches/capabilities) |
| Ethereum | [V3 OpenAPI](https://programmable.market/openapi/custom-launch-v3.json) and [pack configuration](https://programmable.market/schemas/custom-launch/v3/pack-config.json) |
| Detailed request and compatibility reference | [Custom Launch API](custom-launch.md) and [raw agent guide](https://programmable.market/developers/custom-launch-api-v1.md) |

Read `customLaunchApi.partnerCredentials` and `customLaunchApi.agentIntegration` in discovery. A partner root aggregates all partner-attributed launches; each subkey sees its stable lineage, and rotation preserves that history. Use `custom-launch:create` for preflight and creation and `custom-launch:read` for status. No API key can sign or broadcast a wallet transaction.

The [agent remediation catalog](https://programmable.market/policies/custom-launch-agent-remediation-v1.json) explains structured errors and next steps. Preserve the exact request bytes and idempotency key when retrying. Include the returned request ID in support messages; never include the API key.

### Robinhood V4

Robinhood Chain Mainnet uses V4 at `eip155:4663`. CLI `3.3.9` remains the live Ethereum V3 integration. Read the V4 and chain 4663 entries in [live discovery](https://programmable.market/.well-known/programmable.json); require all three public gates and verify the advertised immutable CLI release, source commit, manifest and checksum. Stop while `pending-public-discovery-promotion`, `publicWrites: false`, `publicAuthorization: false` or `releaseReady: false` is reported. A deployed runtime or source candidate is not activation evidence.

The [4.0 OpenAPI](https://programmable.market/openapi/custom-launch-v4.json), [pack config](https://programmable.market/schemas/custom-launch/v4/pack-config.json) and [source verification](https://programmable.market/schemas/custom-launch/v4/source-verification-status.json) preserve historical `4.0.0`. When discovery selects `4.1.0`, use its [OpenAPI](https://programmable.market/openapi/custom-launch-v4.1.json), [pack config](https://programmable.market/schemas/custom-launch/v4.1/pack-config.json) and [source verification](https://programmable.market/schemas/custom-launch/v4.1/source-verification-status.json).

Selected 4.1 requires a request-bound funding plan, exact launch and gas budgets, an atomic initial buy of at least USD 1 at permit authorization, positive minimum token output and a fresh server quote. Gas is additional; count the buy once. Its exact fee kernel accrues 20 bps of the gross native ETH leg once per successful swap, separately from creator and LP fees, as fixed-recipient PoolManager native claims; admission is not collected-revenue proof. Read the [current generated agent guide](https://programmable.market/docs/developers.md) for the exact funding, quote and fee boundary.

Use the returned `resource.launchId` as `LAUNCH_ID`, not the HTTP support request ID. A V4 client must poll with `programmable-launch status LAUNCH_ID --api-version 4 --chain-id 4663 --watch --until authorized`, stop for separate wallet review, signature and broadcast, then poll the same command with `--until finalized`. The CLI never signs or broadcasts. The V4 states are `received`, `validating`, `action_required`, `authorized`, `awaiting_wallet_signature`, `wallet_action_required`, `submitted`, `sequencer_soft_confirmed`, `ethereum_posted`, `finalized` and `failed`. `action_required` is remediation, not a wallet action. Source verification starts after finality and stays independent from indexing, trading and publication.

## Shared token and hook on Robinhood

Use the separate [MultiRole V2 capabilities](https://api.programmable.market/v4/chains/4663/multi-role-custom-launches/capabilities), [guide](https://api.programmable.market/v4/chains/4663/multi-role-custom-launches/guide.md) and [client](https://api.programmable.market/v4/chains/4663/multi-role-custom-launches/client.mjs) for one contract that implements both token and hook. Its request, funding and lifecycle contract is separate from V4 4.1. The automatic economic verifier accepts the exact Native20 recipe and supported constructor configuration; different source code or economic mechanisms return `evidence_required`. Preflight/create uses `custom-launch:create`; status/list uses `custom-launch:read`, bound to chain `4663` and the controller.

Native20 charges 20 bps (0.20%) of gross native ETH per successful buy or sell for Programmable, rounded up per trade. Creator and pool fees are additional. The [fees guide](../economics.md) defines accruals, claims and the [Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/programmablehq/analytics) metrics. Track the [MultiRole finalized feed](https://api.programmable.market/v4/chains/4663/multi-role-custom-launches/finalized) separately from the existing V4 feed.

## Ethereum V3 and public reads

On Ethereum Mainnet, `GET /v3/capabilities` describes the accepted profile and structural limits. Authenticated `POST /v3/custom-launches/preflight` evaluates the exact create bytes without consuming launch-creation quota, allocating a nonce or persisting a launch. It still consumes the ordinary route rate budget, including a partner credential's `prepareRequestsPerHour` budget. The Router V1 permit-reissue disposition route is wallet-key-only.

The server verifies required behavior, fee and liquidity evidence before wallet handoff. A 10 bps platform fee claim applies only to an Ethereum fee-certified profile or adapter and its exact stamped PoolKey. This historical policy is separate from Robinhood Native20.

Ethereum [V2](https://programmable.market/openapi/custom-launch-v2.json) and [V1](https://programmable.market/openapi/custom-launch-v1.json) preserve history and schemas. New creation returns nonretryable `409 CUSTOM_LAUNCH_V2_READ_ONLY` or `409 CUSTOM_LAUNCH_V1_READ_ONLY`; use the advertised V3 profile for new Ethereum submissions.

The Developer API version 2 at `https://developers.programmable.family` is read only and requires no API key. The OpenAPI operations below describe that service, including discovery, deployment manifests and launch reads.
