description: Build, configure and submit a reusable Module Mode program through the API

# Build a module

A Module Mode contribution is a reusable program with a versioned source package. Its configuration, required capabilities, funding and management actions are part of the package. The same package can be used by multiple coins with different configuration values.

The source API accepts contributions through open, versioned runtime and capability names. There is no business-category allowlist. Describe the actual idea and its requirements, including any new execution interface or supporting service. The platform selects a review plan for that source. A missing adapter or test environment is review work that must be resolved before approval and publication.

## Check submission access

Before uploading, the agent checks `moduleContributions.submissions` in public `GET /v1/modules/capabilities` and `authorization.canSubmit` in keyed `GET /v1/modules/context`. Both must be `true`. Context also exposes the deployment's intake readiness as `intake.available`.

The root `reviewAvailable`, `approved` and `available` fields in `/v1/modules/capabilities` remain `false` for compatibility. They do not block uploads or mean your account needs approval. New key issuance has its own `moduleContributions.apiKeyIssuance` flag.

Read review readiness separately from `/v1/modules/review-capabilities` (`reviewAvailable`, `statusReadAvailable`) or authenticated context (`review.available`, `review.statusReadAvailable`). Review readiness is not an intake gate. A source package can wait for a platform review plan after upload. The [API reference](https://programmable.market/developers/module-mode-api-v1.md#check-submission-access-first) explains the fields and the upload check.

## Connect an agent

1. Connect the author's EVM wallet on [API keys](https://programmable.market/developers/api-keys?purpose=modules). Create a key with **Launches + modules** access or use an existing key with `modules:submit` and `modules:read`.
2. Save the key in the agent's private `PROGRAMMABLE_API_KEY` environment. Describe the idea and copy the module prompt. The prompt contains instructions; credentials belong in the agent's secure setup.
3. The agent reads [discovery](https://programmable.market/api/agent), follows `workflows.moduleContribution`, and verifies the current CLI download against its manifest.
4. Before building, it runs `module-context --api-origin https://api.programmable.market` with the verified CLI. The context returns the key's author wallet, default reward wallet, missing permissions, required inputs, intake limits and current review coverage.

The agent uses `identity.author` in the source descriptor and defaults the reward wallet to `identity.defaultRewardWallet`. It should ask for another payout address only when you request one. It chooses routine package details and creates one stable family salt. Missing decisions about the intended behavior, exact assets, funding, exits or external dependencies belong at the start.

An API key authorizes its assigned requests. Module submission needs `modules:submit`; context and private progress reads need `modules:read`. It does not sign transactions or approve a module. Documentation and capability reads are public. The CLI also accepts the older `PROGRAMMABLE_MODULES_API_KEY` alias; configure only one value or keep both identical.

The current standalone CLI is **1.0.0-development.8** and retains the existing source/API and configuration formats. The [API reference](https://programmable.market/developers/module-mode-api-v1.md#before-writing-source) provides the complete context contract, upfront inputs and copyable commands. For an agent starting from an idea, use the contributor prompt.

## Describe the actual runtime

The package declares each component's actual runtime, source path and entrypoint, then the host capabilities and interfaces it needs. Use the existing versioned namespaces; a module does not have to fit a business category or an example. Additional inert requirements can use versioned `extensions` and pinned documentation. The source package schema and its resource limits still apply.

Read `review.profiles` and `review.limits` in authenticated context before choosing an implementation interface. A matching profile can reuse existing review infrastructure. If the idea needs another interface, submit that requirement with its source; do not disguise it as a supported profile. The platform must establish an executable review plan and any host integration before making it available.

The Native source reference uses `programmable.native-solidity@1` to build a program and factory for the callback interface. `programmable.module-engine-solidity@1` builds executable Solidity against `constructor(Context,bytes)`, `contextHash()`, `initialize(bytes)` and `execute(Operation)`. The Engine host binds creation code, canonical constructor arguments, actual runtime and compiler-derived immutable locations for each instance. These interfaces require an operator-authorized plan, isolated compiler/test execution and an independent review decision. The [Engine starter manifest](https://programmable.market/developers/module-mode-starters/engine-program/v0.1.0-development.1/manifest.json) pins a downloadable source archive. Use its implementation only when it fits the idea and replace its fixture identities with the values from context.

The Engine interface supports different operation models. These source references describe behavior and review requirements; they are not a list of available templates:

- **Quote trading:** exact-input buys and sells with a user output minimum. Quote-denominated fees convert to ETH through the reviewed direct Quote/WETH V3 route; WETH unwraps directly. The pool must satisfy the pinned fee tier, real price history, freshness, depth and price-movement checks. A valid contract address alone is insufficient. The user can tighten the conversion minimum but cannot replace the route or weaken its floor.
- **Escrow:** an exact quote deposit creates a liability for the payer; withdrawal follows the recorded unlock rule. The primary coin remains locked and this profile offers no swap market.
- **Creator-attested settlement:** a payer funds an immutable beneficiary, amount, obligation hash and refund deadline. The launch creator can fulfill before expiry; the payer can refund an unresolved request at or after expiry. Creator attestation is the trust model. An evidence hash does not verify external delivery. The downloadable starter fixes request windows between 60 seconds and 30 days and offers no swaps.

The Engine host specification defines exact operation permissions, gas/data bounds, token behavior and quote-market requirements. Transfer-tax or transfer-blocked assets can prevent progress. A new custody rule, price model or external dependency needs executable source and its own evidence.

## General and fixed configuration

SDK development.4 supports `binding: {mode: "input", default?: value}` and `binding: {mode: "fixed", value}` on configuration fields. Input values remain editable within their schema. A fixed field may be omitted or repeated exactly; a different value fails SDK/API compilation with `OPEN_CONFIG_FIXED_OVERRIDE`.

A quote address input belongs to one reusable template, not a ticker-specific source package. A fixed quote template also binds the exact address in the host revision's `fixedQuoteAsset`; its constructor must reject conflicting raw configuration. Hiding a field in the website does not enforce the onchain rule.

General quote trading leaves `fixedQuoteAsset` zero but still binds the reviewed infrastructure with a nonzero `fixedConfigurationHash`. The same configuration derives the direct conversion pool from the chosen quote address and fixed fee tier. General settlement can leave both revision fields zero when its constructor enforces the complete accepted configuration. Use the profile's exact ABI mapping, including tuples, rather than assuming generic record encoding matches Solidity.

## Package requirements

| Part | Include |
| --- | --- |
| Identity | A name, version, stable family identifier, author wallet and reward wallet |
| Source | The complete source files, their hashes, dependencies and reproducible build settings |
| Configuration | Field types, units, defaults, limits and exact encoding |
| Compatibility | Required host capabilities, dependencies, conflicts and resource limits |
| Funding | Assets, amounts, custody, spending rules, failure behavior and refunds |
| Management | Read methods, transaction actions, input schemas and the wallet roles allowed to use them |
| Evidence | Tests, build artifacts and the security and compatibility evidence required by the selected profile |

Both wallets must be nonzero EVM addresses. Use the authenticated context for the author and default reward wallet; an explicit different reward wallet is optional. A family identifies one contribution across its revisions; helper contracts and repeated instances do not create additional reward shares.

Configuration fields and management actions must be described in the supported manifests. The website renders the supported configuration fields and the quote, escrow and settlement controls for their reviewed interfaces. Other admitted Engine operations use **Advanced actions**, with the exact reviewed operation ID, allowed asset roles, amounts, recipient and action data. Required custom initial actions use the same controls during launch. The website simulates the complete host transaction and revalidates permissions before the wallet request; it does not infer a payload ABI or explain opaque action data from its operation ID. Contributors must document that data format.

Custom Engine launches also expose **Advanced launch inputs** for exact creator and engine salts and initialization bytes. These values use the existing compiler and full launch simulation. An entered custom engine salt is preserved; blank salts use fresh random values. The standard quote interface retains its existing address mining. A successful local preparation does not establish public availability or live lifecycle evidence.

Arbitrary frontend code from a submission is not executed by the website. If the module requires a new control type, runtime capability or market engine, include that requirement in the submission for review.

## Submit and follow the review

Use the [API and CLI reference](https://programmable.market/developers/module-mode-api-v1.md) for the exact request format and commands.

| Operation | Endpoint at `https://api.programmable.market` |
| --- | --- |
| Read author, prerequisites and review coverage | `GET /v1/modules/context` with `modules:read` |
| Read intake capabilities | `GET /v1/modules/capabilities` |
| Submit a package | `POST /v1/modules/submissions` |
| List your submissions | `GET /v1/modules/submissions` |
| Read one submission | `GET /v1/modules/submissions/:id` |
| Read review capabilities | `GET /v1/modules/review-capabilities` |
| Read build and review progress | `GET /v1/modules/submissions/:id/review` |
| Export an accepted build | `GET /v1/modules/submissions/:id/review-export` |

Prepare and test the package locally, save the exact request and submit it with a stable idempotency key. Keep the returned submission ID. If the connection fails, retry those same bytes with the same key. Changed source requires a new revision.

The intake receipt is a historical record of the original upload. `status-module` and submission lists retain `draft_received`, `unreviewed`, `approved: false` and `available: false` even after the review advances. Read `review-status-module` or the separate review resource for the current `review.state` and `review.nextAction`; receipt flags do not describe account approval. `awaiting_plan` means the platform must select the build plan or establish missing review coverage. Keep the original submission while it waits for a plan. If the source changes, prepare a linked new version. Review acceptance is followed by registry admission, deployed-code verification and catalog activation. Availability is determined by the active release and catalog.

Sign in with the API key's author wallet to see [Profile → Modules → Submissions](https://programmable.market/profile?section=submissions). A different reward wallet does not own the private history. Each entry shows its current review status and feedback. Use **Copy for agent** to continue that submission with your agent's existing key. The prompt asks it to read the latest review before acting and contains no API key. **Published** shows verified publications; review approval alone keeps the entry in submission history.

After acceptance, the author's `modules:read` key can download the exact plan, artifact and decision through the [HTTP build export](https://programmable.market/developers/module-mode-api-v1.md#export-an-accepted-build-over-http). The response is bounded to 3 MiB. The existing CLI has no export command and keeps its 1 MiB response limit. The export grants no publication authority: the existing authorized operator still performs the protected publication steps, and launch or management transactions require their existing wallet authority.

## Existing coins and indexing

A coin records the module revisions and configuration selected at launch. Later catalog changes do not alter that record. Management actions may change only the state permitted by the deployed contracts.

Indexer integration depends on the launch source version, not module names or categories. A new module using an existing source version keeps the same launch event and identity format. Read [Index Module Mode launches](https://programmable.market/docs/developers/module-mode-indexing) before adding an engine or changing an identity interface.

## Contributor rewards

Fee rules follow the launch source version. Native V2 and the Engine V1 quote trading profile charge 10 bps without eligible families, or 30 bps with them: 10 bps for Programmable and 20 bps shared equally among distinct admitted families. Creator fees are additional. Engine quote fees are charged on gross quote input for a buy and gross quote output for a sell; author claims cover the ETH actually received after conversion. Non-trading operations have no swap-fee basis.

Native V1 retains its original 20-bps rule: 10/10 with eligible families, or the full 20 bps to Programmable without them. Its old ledger and earned claims remain authoritative. Helpers, engine dependencies, imports and repeated instances do not add eligible families. Eligibility is explicitly bound during admission.

Module funding, creator fees and earned author claims remain separate. Changing future creator recipients does not move already earned claims, the module author's reward wallet or a fixed refund beneficiary.

## Recover transactions and claims

Keep the chain, account, token address, exact release identity and transaction hash. After a timeout, check the wallet's submitted transaction and canonical receipt before starting another action. The existing operation recovery client reconciles Native and Engine transactions against their original release, calldata, value and receipt. A saved browser record cannot authorize a new send; a mined receipt is still separate from finalized indexing.

For website-independent reads and wallet preparation, use the Native management client or Engine client from the verified source revision, with the original release evidence and your own RPC. Verify the deployed target and current wallet role before signing. The source-contribution CLI does not send launches, swaps or claims.

Accrued fee claims remain in the original release's ledger. Read `claimable(account)` there and use its verified `claimTo(recipient)` interface from the entitled wallet, with zero native value plus network gas. Engine integrations can use `prepareModuleEngineClaim`; Native integrations use the existing `claim-fees` management intent. The recipient does not choose whose credit is claimed. Module budget rewards and escrow refunds use their separate instance/host actions. A website outage or later release does not transfer these rights to another ledger or administrator.

The contributor reference contains the package layout, build procedure and host interface requirements.
